## Caching - Java Solution
To get up and running quickly, just run the commands:
```bash
./gradlew test
```

Implement the different caching mechanisms in the [app/src/main/java](./app/src/main/java) directory. The provided unit tests in [app/src/test/java](./app/src/test/java) will make sure your implementation is working!
