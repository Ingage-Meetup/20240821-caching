## Solutions
This directory contains solution templates for several languages. Each language has skeleton cache implementations, and unit tests to validate the expected behavior for each of the caching implementations we've discused (FIFO, LIFO, LRU, and LFU).

Feel free to use these templates, or implement your own. If you implement your own keep in mind that the provided unit tests are defining the expected behavior for each cache type, so you'll want to make sure that your implementation satisfies the expected behaviors.
