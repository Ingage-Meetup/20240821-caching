## Caching - C# Solution
To get up and running quickly, just run the commands:
```bash
dotnet test
```

Implement the different caching mechanisms in the [CachingImpl](./CachingImpl) directory. The provided unit tests in [CachingImpl.Tests](./CachingImpl.Tests) will make sure your implementation is working!
